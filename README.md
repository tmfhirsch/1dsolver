# 1dsolver
25/3/2020
Repository for my early learning coding with DEs.

Contains:

nDES: n-dimensional Euler's method ODE solver, created as a proof of understanding before using

1dsolve: Horrific, hard coded solver of the exponential decay problem

DESketch: playing with N dimensional Euler's method solver
and DifferentialEquations.jl package on three simple ODEs

StepPot: Applying DifferentialEquations.jl to the simple
problem of a rectangular step potential. This is the first attempt at solving the Schroedinger equation numerically
